# ChatBTC - AI Chat with Bitcoin Payments

[Live Demo](https://chatbtc.vercel.app/)

## Overview

**ChatBTC** is an AI-powered conversational chatbot similar to ChatGPT, but with a unique twistâ€”it integrates Bitcoin payments for interaction. Instead of a subscription model, users pay for every five messages using **Bitcoin**, offering flexible, usage-based pricing. Payments are processed through **Lightspark**, ensuring fast, secure, and low-cost Bitcoin transactions.

This project is built with **Next.js** and uses **OpenAI's GPT model** to power the chatbot, making it capable of answering a wide range of questions. Its Bitcoin payment integration provides global access and flexibility, catering to crypto enthusiasts and users in regions with limited access to traditional payment systems.

## Features

- **Pay-Per-Use**: Users are charged for every five messages sent through the chatbot, paid using Bitcoin via the Lightspark payment system.
- **Confidentiality**: No need to provide personal information or sign up for a subscription, ensuring privacy.
- **Global Access**: With Bitcoin payments, users from around the world can interact with ChatBTC without traditional banking barriers.
- **Real-time AI Responses**: Powered by GPT-3.5 for fast and accurate conversational responses.
